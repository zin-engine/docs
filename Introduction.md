# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction to ZIN Engine

Welcome to **ZIN Engine** â€” a lightweight, HTML-first engine that lets you build dynamic, SEO-friendly websites **without** the overhead of modern frontend frameworks or complex backend setups.

ZIN is designed to **keep your code close to HTML**, but give it superpowers like templating, data loading, secure form handling, and environment configuration â€” all without writing JavaScript or spinning up a full stack.

## ðŸ§  Why ZIN?

Building even the simplest website today â€” a landing page, portfolio, product site, or business contact page â€” often means:

- Creating templates and shared headers/footers
- Securing form submissions (e.g. with reCAPTCHA)
- Writing server-side scripts for dynamic content
- Managing environment variables and secrets
- Configuring routes, clean URLs, and SEO basics
- Choosing between heavy frameworks (React, Next.js, PHP, etc.)

### ðŸ¤¯ All that, just to build a few pages?

Thatâ€™s where **ZIN** comes in. It handles all of the above with **zero JavaScript**, **zero frameworks**, and just **plain HTML** + smart configuration.

## ðŸª„ What Can ZIN Do?

With ZIN, you can:

âœ… Build with plain HTML + zin-tags  
âœ… Use reusable templates, includes, and partials  
âœ… Load dynamic data from CSV, JSON, APIs, MySQL, or Google Sheets  
âœ… Securely handle form submissions with built-in reCAPTCHA support  
âœ… Configure environment variables with `.env`  
âœ… Set up clean URLs and route rewriting  
âœ… Auto-generate and update `sitemap.xml` and `robots.txt`

## ðŸ§° Who is ZIN For?

ZIN is perfect for:

- **Freelancers and indie devs** building multiple client sites
- **Small teams** who want to avoid JS-heavy stacks
- **Web designers** who prefer working in HTML but need some dynamic logic
- **Developers** who want clean, fast, secure, low-maintenance websites

## âš¡ ZIN Philosophy

> The web was built on HTML. ZIN respects that.

Instead of forcing you into a framework, ZIN gives you flexible, composable tools that work *with* how the web was meant to be built.

## ðŸ“¦ How Does It Work?

Just point ZIN to your project folder and run:

```bash
zin -p 3001 -r "/path/to/my-site"

# Or Simply run it on current directory
zin -p 3001

# Or Just run it on default port 9001, on current directory
zin
````

Thatâ€™s it.

ZIN watches your HTML files, processes dynamic `zin-tags`, applies templates, rewrites routes, and serves your site on a local or production server.

## ðŸ§© Next: What Youâ€™ll Learn

In the docs ahead, youâ€™ll learn how to:

* Set up and configure ZIN
* Structure a project with reusable templates and includes
* Use zin-tags to load data, handle forms, and transform content
* Secure your site with `.env` and control visibility with `.zinignore`
* Deploy your ZIN-powered site

## ðŸ’¬ Final Thought

You donâ€™t need React to build a website.
You donâ€™t need PHP just to submit a form.

With ZIN, **HTML is your superpower again**.
